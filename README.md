# Flow-Waves-SWOT
Code for "SWOT captures hydrologic waves traveling down rivers" (Thurman et al.)

Code Descriptions:

Flow_wave_finder.R:

Finding flow waves from Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) water surface elevation measurements by analyzing US Geological Survey gauge height variations.

Flow_wave_length.R:

Estimating the spatial length of flow waves from SWOT data.

Spatial_hydrograph_separation.R:

Applying a single-parameter digital filter from Chapman and Maxwell (1996) to separate baseflow from total flow for both SWOT and gauge data.
